# robotics_and_perception
Robotics and perception projects from CS3630

## Description
This repo contains all relevant projects completed over the course of CS3630 at the Georgia Institute of Technology. All projects are in jupyter notebook form, and include instructions from the instructors as well as implementations of remaining functions.

## Projects
#### project_2
This project implements a rudimentary vacuum cleaning robot including sensing and policy decisions based on dynamic bayes nets, ancestral sampling, maximum porbable explanations.

#### project_3
Continued implementation of the vacuum cleaning robot, adding markov localization and particle filtering to improve efficiency.

#### project_4
Continued implementation of the vacuum cleaning robot, adding image recognition, rapidly-exploring random trees, and differential drive.

#### project_5
Continued implementation of the vacuum cleaning robot, adding ICP (Iterative Closest Points) algorithm, simultaneous localization and mapping, lidar scanning, and pose graph optimization.

#### project_6
Creates a fully functional simulated drone environment using all previously mentioned concepts in a 3 dimensional space.
